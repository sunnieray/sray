    <h1>About Me </h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Sunnie Ray! I've been coding in the Nashville tech community for one year. <br>
        <p>
        I started my coding journey while working for Lyft, I watched one of our internal tools grow from something I dreaded using to something I cannot see our customer service team functioning without. I began learning on Udemy and Youtube where I learned basic CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I went on to study at Savvy Coders Nashville, where I learned Mobile first design, how to use API's like Firebase, Google Fonts, Parcel bundler. </p>
